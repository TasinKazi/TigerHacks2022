About the project

The problem of high gas prices mainly inspired us. We were going to do an app comparing various transportation options and their cost. We decided to switch to something more feasible to finish within the hackathon's timeframe, so we used a fuel cost calculator. We faced challenges in implementing data from outside resources and ultimately had to come up with other alternatives. We used GitHub, Javascript HTML, VScode, CSS, PHP admin, SQL , and Excel to build the website.
